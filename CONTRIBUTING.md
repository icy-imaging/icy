# Contributing to Icy

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Icy ! :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Icy and its plugins which are hosted in the [BIA group](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/bia) of Institut Pasteur GitLab.

## Code of Conduct

The project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Icy Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I have a question or just want to get help !!!

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question !

You have several ways to get helps for Icy, be sure to read the [Assistance Guide](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/tutorial/how-to-get-help-on-icy) to use the best one for your needs.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

For bug report, consult our [Assistance Guide](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/tutorial/how-to-get-help-on-icy) which provide good practises about how submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community to understand your report, reproduce the behavior and so eventually fixing the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Atom, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.


### Publishing a script or a protocol



### Creating a new plugin

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/flight-manual.atom.io](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io).


### Contributing directly to Icy or an existing plugin (bug fixes, enhancements..)
